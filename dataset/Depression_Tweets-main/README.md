# Depressed Users on Twitter

Repository for [Classifying Social Media Users Before and After Depression Diagnosis via their Language Usage: A Dataset and Study](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.289/) paper, published in LREC-COLING 2024.  All updates on this public dataset can be found in this repository.

The dataset provided consists of approximately 500,000 tweets annotated based on users' disclosed dates of depression diagnosis. Tweets are classified into two classes: before diagnosis and after diagnosis. Tweets labeled "before" were posted prior to the user's reported depression diagnosis, while "after" tweets were posted following the reported diagnosis.

This repository consists of two files:
* Depressed_users_labels.csv: contains ~500k rows, where every row consists of a unique Tweet ID and its according annotation
* Depression_symptoms_lexicon.txt: contains 598 words related to depression symptoms and diagnosis

You can access tweets/posts' texts by retrieving them from X (Twitter) using the tweet IDs in the file. You can do so using X [developer account for academic research](https://developer.x.com/en/use-cases/do-research/academic-research)
