You also need to tell rick your honest thought, don't beat around the bush but let him know you're serious EOS 0.0 0 11 That's good advice! Thanks. I wonder how i can get through to him to really let him know i'm serious. Ideas?  EOS 0.0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same situation myself, what i usually do is sit down with them and start the conversation in a serious mood. Explain everything i need to say and tell them that i mean every word. If they don't seem to accept and change, i keep my distance from them EOS 0.0 0 13 Makes sense. Unfortunately we live on the same street so it's kind of hard not to run into each other. :/  EOS 1.0 1 14 [Other] That's even easier to make it clear, if you run into him, just give him a polite greetings. The point is, make it clear you have had enough

EOS 1.0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance. If he still doesn't respect your words, it's the best for both to say it clearly.

EOS 1.0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Yes. when you are depressed it is hard to become motivated to do anything. However, it is extremely important that you do act.

Action (physically doing something) triggers psychological movement. It will help you move through the pain that you are feeling.

EOS 0.0 0 20 I have a friend who did get it and almost died. He is 40 and pretty healthy. His wife and daughter got it too. They just had flu-like symptoms, but he was in the hospital for 9 days. EOS 0.0 0 21 That was almost 3 months ago and he is still feeling the effects of it.  EOS 1.0 1 22 [Other] So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you. And of course, pray. The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and i still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so i try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.

In the past this has taken me a week to learn and record to memory  EOS 1.0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions] Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.

EOS 0.0 0 14 Perhaps i can ask if i can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however i'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is i'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances.  EOS 0.0 0 15 I suppose i could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days.  EOS 1.0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.

Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however?  EOS 1.0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident.

EOS 0.0 1 20 [Information] I'm glad you feel better. but just a parting shot. Sometimes when one let's their friends know what is really bothering them makes the friends trust them more given that they are open with them and could tell them what they feel deep inside. That's what true friendship is about. It works wonders EOS 0.0 0 21 That's true. Again thank you and i hope the rest of your day goes well. Goodbye.  EOS 1.0 1 22 [Other] You are welcome. Bye

That is, i also had to make sure i wasn't being rude or mean.

I've recently lost my job and i'm just really worried about how my bills are going to get paid. I feel so tired, you know?  EOS 0.0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I totally understand. Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, i'm sorry that happened to you. Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.  EOS 0.0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] There is a concept called maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes i find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking. Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts.  EOS 1.0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do. The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.

So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed. EOS 0.0 0 18 I agree fully and i'm happy for you. I think i've been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything i loved. I used to love jogging but i stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now i don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. I'm usually 130 and i've shot up to 200. So i think if i can just get my routine down and exercise, i'll be alright. EOS 1.0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yep for sure, just get back at it and learn to love it again. Anyways, good talking to you!

My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for cp. My job requires that i be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people i am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103.

I think people put too much emphasis on permanence.

I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what i would want him to do and i think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.

There is a stage of grieving for a lost relationship that happens when a relationship ends. There will be grieving for the person, and for the relationship with that person. That is what has to be processed in order to move on.

He is actually a close friend and i wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.  EOS 1.0 1 10 [Other] Okay i see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost "hiding" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.

EOS 0.0 0 7 I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one. It just feels robotic now.  EOS 1.0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling.

EOS 0.0 0 5 Long story short - at work, a new boss pulled all the leadership out of the jobs they were hired for (some more than 12 years ago - so they have lots of experience) and shuffled them all around to new jobs - all that is except the 5 oldest employees - they got moved into "non-positions".

EOS 0.0 0 10 Yeah, she went again the other day. She is doing quite a bit better. He said because of underlying conditions it may take her longer, but she is doing great. That was encouraging.  EOS 0.0 1 11 [Information] There are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. I am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband.  EOS 1.0 1 12 [Other] I am sure he will be able to find a new job soon as new business start to open, even if it's a temporary one.
