1.0 0 0 Hello  EOS 1.0 1 1 [Questions] How are you feeling?
1.0 0 0 Hello  EOS 1.0 1 1 [Questions] How are you feeling? EOS 1.0 0 2 A bit overwhelmed and depressed. I really want to celebrate the holiday, but i'm just not in the mood.  EOS 1.0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been feeling the same way lately -- my family has been distracted and stressed and it's rubbing off on me. Are there other people around that you can spend time with?

Are there other people around that you can spend time with? EOS 0.0 0 4 Not really, i'm not a people person and the couple people i do talk to aren't supportive or going thru their own issues. EOS 1.0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. It seems to me that much of what makes the holidays worthwhile is the opportunity to spend time with people we care about. It makes sense that you would have a hard time celebrating with nobody there to share it with you.

EOS 1.0 1 21 [Self-disclosure] Something i tend to struggle with is the way things change over time, when they can never go back to the way they were before. When my sisters and i were little, it seemed like everything in the world was so much simpler, and we had certain christmas traditions that we always looked forward to, like cutting down a tree, making pumpkin pie, and singing carols and christmas hymns together. As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do. That has been pretty hard for me because things used to be so much different. Has that been difficult for you, as well? Just the fact that things are different now than when your kids were little.

EOS 1.0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else's business. If you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10.

I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe i need to deal with it directly. EOS 1.0 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you know aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't make you feel any specific way, even if her actions influenced how you were already feeling.

Approaching the problem with positive mindset will help a lot! Is that something you'd be willing to try? EOS 0.0 0 14 I suppose so, but it's hard to break habits and a mindset that i've cultivated.  EOS 1.0 1 15 [Information] That's true. However, research shows that any habit can be broken or formed if you put your mind to it everyday for 5-10 minutes for 3 continuous weeks. Perhaps, replacing your negative thoughts with happy ones might help.

EOS 1.0 1 16 [Other] I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but i can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that you can help.

EOS 0.0 0 7 The current economic climate has really made me fearful....not sure if i am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 1.0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct?

EOS 0.0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 0.0 0 9 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because i don't know if i will always have a job. EOS 1.0 1 10 [Other] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job?
0.0 0 11 Do you know what i mean? EOS 0.0 0 12 What say u? EOS 0.0 0 13 I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. EOS 0.0 0 14 Do you know what i mean?

I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how i feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger EOS 0.0 0 10 That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, i just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, i just don't understand why.  EOS 1.0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.

And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you can do about the situation, you have to pray to god to help you then let it go. If you can not fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.

I think i got anxious last week when i had a tire go flat and took my car in to get it fixed. I found out i need all new tires and new brakes. Not easy on a fixed income. Plus i am widowed.

0.0 0 4 I see. My problem right now is that due to the pandemic and having a lot of time to myself and getting restless, i tend to waste a lot of time doing other things, and procrastinating. So i am catching up and i know i can finish them, but just that i could have done better, so there's an element of guilt and shame involved because i am not happy with my actions on how i handled my studies.  EOS 0.0 0 5 No, not yet. It's distance education so it's mostly me studying on my own time (each course runs at a max duration of six months), but i have reached out to them regarding some assignment and exam questions.  EOS 0.0 0 6 But i do appreciating your sympathetic tone and that you've gone through this also.  EOS 0.0 0 7 And also i go through things slower and things become more sluggish and not really motivated, whereas before i was faster and more productive and really interested in learning and trying to finish assignments etc as quick as i can, and not take the full 6 months of course deadline.  EOS 1.0 1 8 [Information] From what i have seen, people who have noticed they are having issues tend to come out ahead! Its great that you are thinking about how to get through this.

EOS 0.0 0 10 I see. I do see a problem and just last week i kind of started to prioritize things and take things more seriously, as the deadlines wind down. I am a little behind schedule, but not severely.  EOS 0.0 0 11 yes i do that too. I understand what you mean. The problem with me is i alternate with relaxation with studying too much, and blurring those lines too much.  EOS 0.0 0 12 But yes, i have been going back on track since last week and hope it's not too late to catch up  EOS 1.0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That's really great!

EOS 0.0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] Is there an easy way for you to put the other preoccupations to the side so they are not so distracting? EOS 0.0 0 20 yes i understand that too. I tend to be more solitary in nature. For me, i talk to my friend for help, a really close friend for advice and my troubles. But most of the time, i get through these logistical and existential problems myself. Not so much that i don't know how to do them or understand the courses or how to do the assignments, but just help on time management and organiza tion.  EOS 0.0 0 21 yes i can do that.  EOS 1.0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good! I bet that would help out a lot, that tends to be the case for me!
0.0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good! I bet that would help out a lot, that tends to be the case for me! EOS 0.0 0 23 It's harder now though because i am just trapped at home, and plus a lot of my course materials are on the internet and on my laptop (distance education), and so i need to kind of focus on not clicking other stuff (including this website, etc).  EOS 0.0 0 24 yeah that's good to hear but i think you asking these questions does make me focus more on what questions i need to ask myself  EOS 0.0 0 25 like can i put this stuff away, etc.  EOS 1.0 1 26 [Information] Thats good, research has shown that moving our distractions to the side allows us to focus more on the task at hand!
0.0 0 27 Also, with being at home all the time, time is warped for me, such that time passes really fast even though it's been many hours. And i then realize the time wasted, etc, just some observations.  EOS 0.0 0 28 ok, will do.  EOS 0.0 0 29 I think our conversation so far has been fruitful in that i have a better idea on what my priorities ought to be.  EOS 0.0 0 30 In fact, me chatting with you right now is just because i am on a self-imposed break, and not a diversion.  EOS 1.0 1 31 [Other] I am glad to hear that!

EOS 0.0 0 33 like passing, i could, but at the same time i don't want to just pass the courses barely. I am not a terrible student, but just disappointed because i ought to know and do better.  EOS 0.0 0 34 But yes, i think i am ready to take on the challenge and burden again and thanks a lot  EOS 1.0 1 35 [Other] I am glad i was able to help, you got this, i bet you don't have this issue again.

This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time.

Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city.  EOS 0.0 0 4 I live in canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so  EOS 0.0 0 5 so that adds anxiety to me when i go out and i am more on guard and paranoid  EOS 1.0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that.

EOS 0.0 0 11 I go out pretty much only when i have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, i just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time.  EOS 0.0 0 12 And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after march. My life has been on hold and i am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like i am still stuck in march.  EOS 1.0 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives.

0.0 0 16 yes correct  EOS 0.0 0 17 Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as i used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (i sleep a lot later than i should).  EOS 0.0 0 18 So i am disappointed in myself to say the least.  EOS 0.0 0 19 and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive  EOS 1.0 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way.

Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling. EOS 0.0 0 23 yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but i didn't want to gamble and compromise.

EOS 0.0 1 25 [Questions] Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them? EOS 0.0 0 26 We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come.  EOS 0.0 0 27 I thought about that  EOS 1.0 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves.
0.0 0 27 I thought about that  EOS 0.0 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves. EOS 0.0 0 29 to the gym, i certainly would. Because it's indoors and i do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running i felt that way because the path that i usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, i did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But i finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business.  EOS 0.0 0 30 but that's just me, and i know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc.  EOS 1.0 1 31 [Questions] Have you ever heard of the phrase "black or white thinking?" as in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible?
0.0 1 31 [Questions] Have you ever heard of the phrase "black or white thinking?" as in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible? EOS 0.0 0 32 so in my opinion, i feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like i live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So i don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what i could have done, but that i had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So i just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when i could have done that anytime i wanted.  EOS 0.0 0 33 black and white thinking...let me think  EOS 0.0 0 34 for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white  EOS 1.0 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, i think i understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk.
0.0 0 38 but i know i am pretty extreme in my thinking.  EOS 0.0 0 39 I really love the outdoors and i go out pretty often before the pandemic.  EOS 0.0 0 40 But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it.  EOS 0.0 0 41 But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell.  EOS 1.0 1 42 [Information] I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white.

We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white. EOS 0.0 0 43 yeah i understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises.  EOS 0.0 0 44 that's good analysis by the way.  EOS 0.0 0 45 But anyhow i am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs.  EOS 1.0 1 46 [Questions] Does this time have to be a "waste" for you? With no productivity? That seems pretty extreme.
0.0 0 47 it's a fascinating area though, fascinating thinking. I am also curious on the social and mental implications of this in the long-run  EOS 0.0 0 48 but only time will tell  EOS 0.0 0 49 there will be so much research and books written about our times.  EOS 0.0 0 50 well i do a lot of "waste" at home. So i am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home.  EOS 1.0 1 51 [Providing Suggestions] Thanks for saying that! I liked talking with you, and we can wrap this up. I guess i'm saying you sound thoughtful and intelligent, i'm confident that you could find ways to get more out of this time if that's what you're wanting to do.

EOS 0.0 0 63 Yeah for sure  EOS 0.0 0 64 I worked out a little bit before i started the chat. I am also doing some online courses on my own time. So i will keep working hard on those. And i hope to get back more into the routine of working out. I really do think it helps my mood if i just make more time and motivation for that.  EOS 0.0 0 65 And you seem intelligent and analytical also and you know what i mean. So i do appreciate your time and input  EOS 1.0 1 66 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Nice!

I had a transition meeting today to pass on the little bit of my work that will be left to another person. I have 2 children; one who just started college this fall and another who is a junior in high school. my elderly mother lives with me also so i can't sell my house any time soon and move into something smaller and cheaper.

I'm fine if people aren't responsive to my personal ideas, but as far as a work situation - or any situation where there are pre-agreed situations that must be dealt in certain ways - that is frustrating. I think i expect too much from people - but really my expectations aren't that high, i don't think - if i really think about it.  EOS 1.0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions] That makes sense, but it might be helpful to think about the other person's situation. Perhaps he/she hasn't had the same amount of training? Perhaps, they just need a little more guidance than other people who are more able to complete the tasks.

EOS 0.0 0 14 Well, it seems someone has to have to have gone through some hard times as well, for me to relate to them. And to have learned from those hard times.

It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously.

EOS 0.0 0 3 It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and i think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.  EOS 1.0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because i didn't feel like i loved him as much as i used to. Things like that are important!

That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you?

EOS 0.0 0 9 Yes that's right, i helped her get a job and thought i'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks i'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke i think.  EOS 1.0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I think it's great that we got matched up, because i went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and i were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when i felt like we needed to break up, i was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.

EOS 0.0 0 11 It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she  EOS 0.0 0 12 she's safe etc  EOS 1.0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!

EOS 1.0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions] Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.

It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually i think it is equally hard for the dumper!  EOS 1.0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore.

The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.  EOS 1.0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard

I suppose i'm fearful that it will never end but i'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if i continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that i think!  EOS 1.0 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, i can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But i think you are going to be able to do that just fine!

The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, i had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, i asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and i realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?

EOS 0.0 0 14 It has been happening for at least 6 months now and it usually happens every weekend  EOS 1.0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions] I can sense your frustration. It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue. Do you think that might help?
