### Added
- To support future research, we release `FailedESConv.json`, 196 negative samples of emotional support conversations that were primarily dropped when we were collecting ESConv.
    - Our rule to determine an effectively negative sample: (# of turn > 2 AND # of speaker > 1)  AND ((post-conversation survey was done AND (negative emotion intensity does not decrease OR empathy score <=2 OR relevance score <=2 )) OR (the support-seeker did not finish the post-conversation survey AND the support-seeker's last feedback score <= 2) )

## Data

The corpus file is `ESConv.json`. We have collected **more** conversations with more problem topics. ESConv now contains 1,300 conversations with 10 topic problems.

### Statistics

\* denotes the new topics added during the second collection. We hope new data supports the future research in transferring the ability of models from old topics to new ones.

## Model Implementation

We provide two versions of model implementation:

- `codes` is the version that we used in the original experiments
- `codes_zcj` is the version reproduced by  [@chujiezheng](https://github.com/chujiezheng)
